Walked into this one by chance while walking home. Decided to drop by the Light Box and this movie's time seemed about right.

Started off real slow, and kind of labored but little by little, it began to reveal some interesting little nuggets. It's about a lady, in Mexico somewhere, with a (barely noticeable) scar on her temple, taking care of her rich and greedy aunt, meanwhile having lustfull fantasies about the various men she encounters. Eventually she gets with one of them. And there's a fire in there somewhere.

An odd wrinkle is the way the aunt's manor reminded me of the manor in Roma, leading me to wonder if it's not a coincidence that this movie was playing at the Light Box (both movies are set in Mexico). Over all I think I got more out of this movie, even though I couldn't really tell you waht the point of either movie was. Both to me were mostly about enjoying the moments along the way, whichever ones jumped out at you. For some it seems a lot of those nuggets came from humor as several people in the theatre kept laughing at seemingly mundane quips and innuendos. The laughter kept coming from different corners of the theatre, so I suppose as far as various elderly demographics humor goes, this movie's got range.

Also, it was kind of interesting seeing the various shots of the shabby train station (which reminded me of back home each time), the restaurants which seemed both fancy and kind of run down at the same time, but in a cool way. I'd have liked to hang out at one of them.

Enjoyed myself over all. Not a bad way to break the ice with the Light Box after being away for about a month.

Side note: This movie has no wikipedia page yet. Odd.
