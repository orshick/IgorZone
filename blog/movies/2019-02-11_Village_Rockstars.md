Another fairly random walk in. Look, I'm at a time of my life where the time the movie plays is more important than the movie itself, ok? OK.

So this is a movie from what I call the international film festival genre. These are movies that aren't really meant to entertain or even be _good_. They're just meant to be _about_ something important. They're also about getting a ticket to get noticed by the outside world, making a movie in a region without much of a movie industry. Lots of disaffected camera shots of people having mundane conflicts with each other. Nothing really concludes from it, but the audience is better off for having witnessed these moments. I say this faecetiously but I actually think this movie did a fine job of doing just that. It might as well have been a documentary. Sure its staged, but to me it worked as essentially one stretched out re-enactment segment from a documentary movie that somehow managed to get screened at TIFF.

Speaking of place, this one is set in a village in India. It mostly concerns the things one would expect to see there. Kids going to some trouble to go to school. Kids playing around (sometimes with fake instruments, hence the title). Kids getting into fights, and climbing trees. Monsoons coming in and wiping away the work of people who seem to be trapped in a cycle of poverty.

There really wasn't much of anything pushing the story forward except maybe a thin thread about the protagonist collecting money to buy a real guitar. The monsoon puts an end to that dream if I remember correctly, but the matter-of-fact way the movie was shot didn't really lend much drama to this part of the movie either.

But this isn't to say I didn't like the movie. I liked this documentary about life in an Indian village just fine. It was alright.
