It was between this movie and the animated shorts of the 2019 Oscars awards. This movie won out due to a more convenient time. Like all 4 of the movies I saw at the Light Box in 2019 so far (writing this on March 12, 2019), I knew virtually nothing about it going in. It was directed by the guy(s) who did The Red Shoes (which I've never seen but knew people fawn over), that was about all I had.

So, I didn't really understand opera before going into this movie, but I had a pretty good time watching it anyway in my disaffected mode of watching movies. It was novel, it had pretty, moving pictures and it felt like a cultural experience. I guess that's all it takes, at least when I'm in the mood for a movie at the Light Box.

Seriously though, I don't get Operatic singing. I feel like I couldn't tell you a difference between a legitimate good operatic song and a parody. Everyone just sang the most mundane bits of conversation, without any rhyme or melody.
